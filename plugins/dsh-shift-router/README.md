# dsh-shift-router

**A two-tier model router for DeepSeek Harness** — automatic execution/judgment routing with an LLM Judge, multi-model fallback chains, exponential-backoff runtime failover, and task-level orchestration.

A DSH adaptation of [pi-shift-router](https://github.com/green-dalii/pi-shift-router).

Routine turns shouldn't cost flagship money. The turns that matter shouldn't be left to a cheap model.

Before every turn of a top-level agent, a small **LLM Judge** (running on your Fast-tier model chain) classifies the user's message as `fast` (routine) or `smart` (consequential). The chosen tier then drives the whole turn — thinking, tool calls, code edits — through the harness's own `agent/request` pipeline. The Judge only classifies; it never does the work.

```text
🦾 [deepseek-v4-flash] → fix the failing test
🧭 judging…
🧠 [deepseek-v4-pro]   ← "design the auth flow" → upgraded instantly
⚠️ deepseek-v4-flash 429 → cooldown, retrying on glm-5.2 — retry in 1m
🦾 [glm-5.2]           ← same-tier failover
```

## Features

- **Instant upgrades, trend-gated downgrades** — one `smart` verdict switches to the strong tier immediately; coming back down requires a sliding-window majority (default 5 turns, ≥60%, low-confidence votes ignored).
- **Cache-aware routing** — when Fast and Smart share a provider, the router raises the downgrade threshold (0.9) and holds off while the prompt cache is warm, so switching to a cheaper model never costs more than staying put.
- **Runtime failover** — 429 / 5xx / quota failures put the model into exponential-backoff cooldown (1m → 4m → 16m → 1h → 6h cap; client-side limits start at 16m) and re-resolve the same tier to the next healthy model — same-turn retry, never cross-tier.
- **Task-level orchestration** — complex tasks (a `smart` verdict) run the Smart tier as a **CTO** that plans, delegates implementation to Fast engineer subagents via the harness's `subagent` tool, reviews each result, and iterates. The hard caps are **enforced by the plugin**, not just prompted: each delegation counts a round, each failed worker result counts an escalation, and once a cap is hit the `subagent` tool is denied outright and the system prompt switches to a "wrap up now" notice.
- **Deployment-aware subagent routing** — every spawned/forked worker is independently classified as `tiny`, `fast`, `code`, `smart`, `heavy`, or `image`, then routed across the provider/model list actually advertised by DSH. Authentication/configuration failures poison a provider for the process and retry the next finite candidate; transient failures poison only the failed model.
- **Subscription-first cost policy** — `opencode-go` and `qwen-token-plan-cn` are treated as subscription routes. Every provider declared through DSH's configurable-provider surface is always classified as **PAYG custom**, even if its ID resembles a subscription route. Capability remains the primary constraint; subscription wins within an equal task-fit band.
- **Cost telemetry** — per-tier token/throughput tracking and an optional USD pricing table (`/router stats` shows "what this session would have cost on the Smart model").
- **Zero-config startup** — a no-op until you configure tiers; then routing just works. Configuration is editable live via the GUI settings panel **and** `/router config` commands (persisted, no restart).

## Install

### As a bundle (recommended)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/qtimy/dsh-cloud-server-plugins.git
cd dsh-cloud-server-plugins/plugins/dsh-shift-router
npm install && npm run build
dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-shift-router
```

The bundle's `cordis.patch.yml` inserts the plugin into any profile that lists it. The plugin loads without any configuration (all defaults are safe); tier models come from the settings panel or the patch row.

Build the plugin in the collection checkout and add its persistent local path. pnpm ≥ 10 can refuse git dependencies' `prepare` scripts by default, so this collection does not recommend installing the monorepo as a package URL:

```yaml
allowBuilds:
  dsh-shift-router: true
```

> This grants the package permission to run its build script at install time. For a fully lock-down install, use `npm run build` on a source checkout (below) instead.

### From source (local development)

Point the profile's patch layer at the built entry:

```yaml
# ~/.dsh/profiles/<name>/cordis.patch.yml
- insert:
    - id: shift-router
      name: '/absolute/path/to/dsh-shift-router/dist/index.js'
      config:
        tiers:
          fast:
            models:
              - { provider: opencode-go, model: deepseek-v4-flash, priority: 1 }
          smart:
            models:
              - { provider: opencode-go, model: deepseek-v4-pro, priority: 1 }
```

## Hot reload

DeepSeek Harness supports hot reload through `@deepseek-ai/cordis-plugin-hmr`, but two things are worth knowing:

1. **The official Web bundle ships the shared HMR row disabled** (`packages/bundle/web-app/cordis.patch.yml` has `- id: hmr, disabled: true`, upstream TODO: "Re-enable shared HMR for Web after its reload lifecycle is tested"). Re-enable it in your profile patch — this is the documented override mechanism:

   ```yaml
   # ~/.dsh/profiles/<name>/cordis.patch.yml
   - id: hmr
     disabled: false
   ```

2. **What hot-reloads and what doesn't** (verified against the current implementation):
   - ✅ **Configuration changes** — editing this profile patch (or the home patch) re-runs the affected plugin's `apply()` with the new config, no restart. The plugin's own config is also hot through the settings namespace (`/router config set` and the GUI card apply live without HMR at all).
   - ❌ **Module (code) changes** — the HMR accepted-dependency graph currently covers the harness's own modules only; editing an external plugin's compiled files (e.g. `dist/index.js`) does not trigger a reload in the current release, so code changes still require a restart. This is the untested "reload lifecycle" the upstream TODO refers to, not a limitation of this plugin.
   - ❌ **Client package metadata** — the `dsh.client` manifest and `exports["./client"]` are cached in-process; adding/fixing them requires a profile restart (only `dist/client.js` content changes ride the client HMR rebuild chain).

   In practice: configure with `/router config` / the settings panel (always live), switch models by editing the patch (live once HMR is on), and restart only when you change plugin code.

## Configuration

Configuration lives in the **`shift-router` settings namespace**: edit it in the GUI (**Settings → Plugins → Plugin configuration** — the "Shift-Router" card), with `/router config` commands, or via the profile patch row. All fields have safe defaults.

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch |
| `tiers.fast.models` | `[]` | Fast-tier chain (`provider/model` + `priority`); also the Judge's model chain |
| `tiers.smart.models` | `[]` | Smart-tier chain |
| `routing.mode` | `auto` | `auto` (default): judge + routing + failover + orchestration; `manual`: no judge, only explicit `/route-force` overrides; `off`: fully passive for model selection (commands/telemetry still work) |
| `routing.judgeTimeout` | `5000` | Judge call timeout (ms) |
| `routing.judgeMaxTokens` | `4000` | Max output tokens for a single Judge call |
| `routing.judgePromptCap` | `6000` | Max prompt characters sent to the Judge (bounds Judge cost) |
| `routing.window.size` | `5` | Downgrade sliding window size |
| `routing.window.threshold` | `0.6` | Fast-majority ratio required to downgrade |
| `routing.window.minConfidence` | `0.5` | Ignore judge verdicts below this confidence |

| `routing.cacheAware.sameFamilyThreshold` | `0.9` | Downgrade threshold when tiers share a provider |
| `routing.cacheAware.idleBoundaryMs` | `300000` | Idle gap before a warm cache is considered cold |
| `orchestration.mode` | `auto` | `auto`: complex → Smart CTO; `off`: plain two-tier routing |
| `orchestration.maxRounds` | `3` | Delegate→review rounds hard cap (**enforced**: each subagent delegation counts one round; at the cap the subagent tool is denied) |
| `orchestration.escalationThreshold` | `2` | Failed worker results before Smart must take over the phase (**enforced**: each `isError` subagent result counts) |
| `orchestration.requireSmartModel` | `true` | Skip orchestration if the Smart model can't be resolved |
| `subagents.enabled` | `true` | Classify and route subagent/fork workers against the live deployment catalog |
| `subagents.judgeTimeout` | `5000` | Per-model child-task judge timeout (ms) |
| `subagents.judgeMaxTokens` | `256` | Maximum child-task judge output tokens |
| `subagents.judgePromptCap` | `4000` | Maximum delegated-task characters sent to the child judge |
| `subagents.catalogRefreshMs` | `300000` | Provider/model catalog refresh interval; adapter changes refresh immediately |
| `subagents.verbose` | `false` | Log child classification, selected billing class, and failover decisions |
| `failover.baseMs` | `60000` | Cooldown base delay for 5xx failures (1m) |
| `failover.maxMs` | `21600000` | Hard cap on the backoff ladder (6h) |
| `failover.startAttempts4xx` | `3` | 4xx (429/quota) failures start at this attempt (16m), client limits usually outlive server blips |
| `failover.speedWindowSize` | `5` | Recent tokens/sec readings kept for the `/router stats` average |
| `telemetry.callLogCap` | `1000` | Max per-message attribution records kept for baseline cost computation |
| `ux.routerLogVerbose` | `false` | Print router decisions to the harness log |
| `pricing` | `[]` | Optional `{provider, model, input, output, cacheRead?, cacheWrite?}` USD-per-1M-token table for cost telemetry |

> All numeric fields are range-validated by the schema (e.g. `window.threshold` must be in [0,1], `window.size` a positive integer); invalid values are rejected at load / on `set`, never silently accepted.

### GUI configuration card

The package ships a browser-side (client) module that registers a **"Shift-Router"** card in the GUI settings page:

- **Where**: Settings → Plugins → Plugin configuration (that page is provided by the official `dsh-client-ui-settings-plugins`; the card registers into the `settings.plugin.item` slot).
- **What**: a form over every scalar leaf field (booleans, numbers, enums) **plus the two tier model chains**, grouped into seven sections (General / Models / Routing / Orchestration / Failover / Telemetry / Logs & UX) with sub-groups for the routing section (Judge / Decision window / Cache-aware). Scalar fields use the compact settings-row pattern — label + hint on the left, control right-aligned on the same line — so each field is one tight row instead of three stacked lines. Controls use the host-plane design tokens: toggle switches (contrast-safe in light and dark themes), a styled select for enums, unit suffixes inside numeric inputs (`ms`, `tokens`, `0–1`, …), and an ordered row editor for model chains — the row order is the in-tier fallback order, so the first available model wins and the rest are its fallbacks. The provider/model dropdowns are auto-loaded from **DSH's runtime model catalog** (`llm.models` — the same catalog the DSH settings surface reads): only providers with a currently advertised model list appear, no dormant-directory noise, and nothing is hardcoded, so the card works with any deployment's configured models. A "Custom…" escape covers values outside the catalog. Staged saving, per-field reset to default, and override markers work exactly like the official cards.
- **Boundary**: only `pricing` (the optional USD cost table) stays with `/router config` and the profile patch; the tier model chains are editable in the card.
- **Build**: `npm run build` emits both the host artifact (`dist/index.js`) and the client bundle (`dist/client.js`). The client module is discovered through the `dsh.client` manifest by `dsh-client-modules`, which requires the plugin to be mounted **by package name (`dsh-shift-router`)** — a source-checkout patch (`name: '/path/dist/index.js'`) does not serve the card.

#### Upstream limitation: the Web settings whitelist (0.1.0-rc.6)

The current Harness Web API proxy (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-host-apiproxy`) **whitelists** which settings namespaces the browser may read and write (`WEB_SETTINGS_NAMESPACES`). The official cards (`shell`, `agent-loop`, `web-search-deepseek`) are on the list; a third-party namespace is filtered out of the browser's `settings.describe` response even though the plugin registered it server-side. The upstream comment explicitly calls moving that decision to `settings.register()` (letting a plugin self-expose) "deferred work", and the list is not configurable.

So the card needs `shift-router` added to the whitelist (one-time, idempotent):

```sh
npm run build
dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-shift-router
node scripts/expose-gui-settings.mjs --profile web   # adds shift-router to the whitelist
# restart the profile (client package metadata and the apiproxy are cached in-process)
```

`scripts/expose-gui-settings.mjs` patches the profile's installed `dsh-host-apiproxy/lib/index.js` (idempotent; re-run after upgrading/reinstalling the dependency).

## Commands

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `/router` | Compact status |
| `/router status` / `/router stats` | Full status: tiers, window, transitions, cooldowns, tokens, cost telemetry |
| `/router on` / `/router off` | Enable / disable (session-scoped) |
| `/router verbose` | Toggle verbose router logging |
| `/router orchestrate auto\|off` | Orchestration mode |
| `/router catalog` | Re-read the complete deployment provider directory, show active/dormant state plus subscription, built-in PAYG, and custom PAYG classifications |
| `/router config` | Interactive editor: numbered field list with current values + available providers + usage |
| `/router config get <N\|path>` | Show one field's current value, e.g. `get 4` or `get routing.judgeTimeout` |
| `/router config set <N\|path> <value>` | Set one field (persisted), e.g. `set 4 8000`, `set tiers.fast.models [...]` (JSON values auto-parsed) |
| `/router config unset <N\|path>` | Clear a user override — the field reverts to its composition default |
| `/router config diff` | List the overrides the user layer currently holds |
| `/router config set-fast <provider/model>` | Replace the Fast tier chain with one model |
| `/router config set-smart <provider/model>` | Replace the Smart tier chain with one model |
| `/router config reset` | Restore the composition default |
| `/route-force <fast\|smart\|auto\|provider/model>` | Force the next turn to a tier/model (one-shot) |

## How it works (DSH integration)

| Capability | DSH mechanism |
|------------|---------------|
| Turn-start classification | `agent/pre-step` waterfall (`step === 1`; two tiers for top-level agents, six task classes for subagents) |
| Model switching | `agent/request` waterfall (per-step provider/model override) |
| Runtime failover | `agent/request-error` waterfall (cooldown + `{kind:'retry'}` same-tier retry) |
| Judge LLM calls | `ctx.llm.stream()` — reuses the harness's adapters, credentials, and JSON-mode enforcement |
| Orchestrator instruction | `ctx.systemPrompt.section()` rendered per agent while orchestration is active |
| Orchestration hard caps | `tools/pre-execute` denies the `subagent` tool at the cap; `tools/result` counts failed workers; the prompt section switches to a "wrap up" notice |
| Deployment catalog | `ctx.llm.listProviders()` + `listModels()` + `listConfigurableProviders()`; declared custom routes are always PAYG |
| Subagent model switching/failover | agent-scoped `agent/request` and `agent/request-error`; inherited parent defaults are replaced, explicit child pins are preserved |
| Config (GUI + commands) | `dsh-settings` namespace `shift-router`; `/router config` is a numbered editor over it (`settings.update` / `settings.mutate` path ops); the GUI card is a client module binding the same namespace via `settingsScope` + the `settings.plugin.item` slot |
| Usage telemetry / cooldown recovery | `session/event` `assistant/message` (TokenUsage; a successful message clears the model's cooldown) |
| Commands | `ctx.commands.register()` |
| Tier-chain prompt variables | `{{shift_router_fast_chain}}` / `{{shift_router_smart_chain}}` |

**Subagents are routed independently.** Workers spawned by `subagent` or `subagent_fork` carry `session.header.origin === 'subagent'`; Shift-Router classifies the delegated task, chooses from the live deployment catalog, and applies a finite fallback chain. An explicitly pinned child model is preserved; only the inherited parent default is replaced.

### Orchestration and the DSH subagent tool

The original pi plugin delegated through pi-subagents with `agent: "worker"`, `context: "fresh"`, and a per-call model pin. DSH's `subagent` tool differs:

- The tool takes `description` + `prompt` (and `run_in_background`); a worker runs in its **own fresh session** — the prompt is its world.
- By default a worker inherits the parent's model. Shift-Router recognizes that inherited value and replaces it with its catalog-ranked child route; a genuinely explicit child model remains untouched.
- The child judge walks the configured Fast chain. Shift-Router reads DSH's complete configurable provider directory for visibility, then limits execution candidates to the active provider/model catalog. This removes the standalone orchestrator's hardcoded model table, reports dormant providers without trying to route through them, and keeps routing synchronized with deployment changes.

The caps are enforced by the router, not just described: every `subagent` tool call while an orchestration turn is active increments `orchestration.rounds`; every failed (`isError`) subagent result increments `orchestration.escalations`; once `capHit()` is true the `subagent` tool is **denied** at `tools/pre-execute` and the orchestrator prompt section is replaced by a "wrap up now" notice. `/router status` shows the live counters (`round x/max, esc y/threshold`).

## Development

```sh
npm run build       # tsc (host → dist/) + tsc client + tsdown (client bundle → dist/client.js)
npm test            # vitest (122 tests: top-level/child routing, catalogs, failover, orchestration, config, GUI)
npm run typecheck
```

### End-to-end test (no credentials)

`e2e/` contains a fake LLM adapter that registers the `fake` provider, so the whole routing pipeline can be exercised without any API key:

```sh
# after creating a scratch profile with this bundle + @deepseek-ai/dsh-headless:
dsh --profile <tmp> --patch e2e/overlay.yml "design a migration plan for our billing system"
# → ROUTER-E2E: turn ran on fake/fake-smart   (judge said smart → upgraded to the Smart tier)
```

The e2e also verifies the settings namespace persists (`e2e/settings-probe.mjs`).
